## TURN server

- Since a direct socket is often not possible between the clients (unless they reside on the same local network)
- TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT) : protocol for relaying network traffic.
- There are currently several options for TURN servers available online, both as self-hosted applications (like the open-source COTURN project) and as cloud provided services.
- Once you have a TURN server available online, all you need is the correct `RTCConfiguration` for your client application to use it.

Eg:

```js
const iceConfiguration = {
  iceServers: [
    {
      urls: 'turn:my-turn-server.mycompany.com:19403',
      username: 'optional-username',
      credentials: 'auth-token',
    },
  ],
};

const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(iceConfiguration);
```
