## Getting started with remote streams

- Once a RTCPeerConnection is connected to a remote peer, it is possible to stream audio and video between them.
- This is the point where we connect the stream we receive from getUserMedia() to the RTCPeerConnection.
- A media stream consists of at least one media track, and these are individually added to the RTCPeerConnection when we want to transmit the media to the remote peer.

Eg:

```js
const localStream = await getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(iceConfig);
localStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => {
  peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream);
});
```

> **Note**: Tracks can be added to a RTCPeerConnection before it has connected to a remote peer. so it makes sense to perform this setup as early as possible instead of waiting for the connection to be completed.

### Adding remote tracks

- To receive the remote tracks that were added by the other peer, we register a listener on the local `RTCPeerConnection` listening for the track event.
- The `RTCTrackEvent` contains an array of `MediaStream` objects that have the same `MediaStream.id` values as the peer's corresponding local streams.

> **Note**: while `MediaStream` IDs match on both sides of the peer connection, the same is generally not true for `MediaStreamTrack` IDs.

Eg:

```js
const remoteVideo = document.querySelector('#remoteVideo');
peerConnection.addEventListener('track', async (event: RTCTrackEvent) => {
  const [remoteStream] = event.streams;
  remoteVideo.srcObject = remoteStream;
});
```
